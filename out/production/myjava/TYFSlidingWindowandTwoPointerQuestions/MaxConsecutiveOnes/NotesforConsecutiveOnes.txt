QUESTION
You have been given an array now your job is to find
longest number of consecutive number of 1s
here is the twist you at max flip K 0s to form the 
longest chain of 1s





In this package you will see 
int total 3 solutions
First one the worst time complexity which is near about O(N^2)
Second one with a time complexity of O(N + N) which is O(2N)
The third and best time complexity of O(N)
