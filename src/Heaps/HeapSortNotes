for HeapSorting
for Ascending Order sorting of a Heap we use MaxHeap
because in MaxHeap we take the largest element at the Root and swap it with the last element at the end

and for Descending Order Sorting of a Heap we use MinHeap
because in Minheap we take the smallest element at the Root and swap it with the last element at the end

for both the cases we need to call the Heapify Function for the Non Root Nodes
